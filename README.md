# Employee Attrition Analysis and Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze employee attrition data and predict attrition rates using various machine learning models such as Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression. The analysis explores different factors influencing employee turnover, including age, business travel, department, education field, and years spent at the company.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition** dataset, which contains various attributes related to employee demographics, job roles, and satisfaction levels.

## Project Structure

- `ML_PROJECT_2.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis and machine learning model development.
- `WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv`: The dataset used for the project.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Analyzed the attrition rate by various features such as Age, Business Travel, Department, and Education Field.
Visualized the distribution and correlation of the features to understand their impact on attrition.
## Models Used
Gaussian Naive Bayes: A probabilistic model used for classification.
Decision Tree Classifier: A model that splits the data into subsets based on feature values to make predictions.
Logistic Regression: A statistical model that predicts the probability of a binary outcome.
## Results
The Decision Tree model achieved an accuracy score of X% on the test set.
The Logistic Regression model showed the best accuracy with a score of Y%.
Detailed performance metrics like F1-Score, Precision, and Recall are available in the notebook.
## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and model performance, the Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models provide valuable insights into employee attrition factors. Future work can include tuning the hyperparameters further and experimenting with more complex models like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting Machines.
